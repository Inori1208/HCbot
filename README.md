## alpha1.0 2022/10/16
    Started to create the project.
    Construct the coding environment, install discord.py and let the bot online.
    Also made 2 commands: aireu(test for response) and ping.
## alpha1.1 2022/10/16
    create a simple database.
    Using json to store the token of my bot.
## alpha2.0 2022/10/17
    Classify the archives, making the subsequent update easier to code and differentiate each commands or functions.
    Also adding load, unload and unload commands.
## alpha2.1 2022/10/18
    Adding on_message event.
    Debugging on "await" things.
## alpha2.2 2022/10/21
    Adding time_task, a function working on background.
    Also the settime command, using the messages bot got, change the "time" section in the json file.
## alpha2.3 2022/10/23
    Use datetime module to set a auto timer, which will tell everyone in the channel how many days left before the exam every day.
    Also add a command which will do the same thing but we can check it whenever we want.
## alpha2.4 2022/10/27
    Trying to make a simple game, still don't have any idea, but I had successfully done a sign up command. 
    Also making a calendar at the same time, still working on it.
## alpha2.5 2022/11/8
    Successfully complete the sign up command, and sort all player data in json file.
    Started to plan out the simple game, maybe a RPG game.
